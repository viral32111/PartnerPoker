# Partner Poker

This is a mobile application for Android that lets you send cute & romantic messages to your partner ðŸ’•

It currently uses [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/products/auth/) to let users sign-in with their Google account, and I plan to use [Firebase Cloud Messages](https://firebase.google.com/products/cloud-messaging/) with [Firebase Functions](https://firebase.google.com/products/functions/) for the real-time messaging.

## Background

I have been interested in [Google's Firebase Platform](https://firebase.google.com/products-build) for a while, but I never had any good ideas on what I should use it for, until I saw [a video on TikTok which showcased a similar application](https://www.tiktok.com/@scratch_adventure1/video/7112732787085430059), so that is what inspired this project.

I wanted to use Kotlin instead of Java, as the few Android applications I have created in the past used Java and I got quite fed up of writing loads of boilerplate code, plus [Kotlin seems to be what the industry is moving towards for modern Android application development](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2019/05/kotlin-is-everywhere-join-global-event.html).
