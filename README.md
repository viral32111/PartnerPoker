# Partner Poker

This is a mobile application for Android that lets you send cute & romantic messages to your partner ðŸ’•

It uses [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) to handle authentication, cloud messages, and other backend services.

## Background

I have been interested in [Google's Firebase Platform](https://firebase.google.com/products-build) for a while, but I never had any good ideas on what I should use it for, until I saw [a video on TikTok which showcased a similar application](https://www.tiktok.com/@scratch_adventure1/video/7112732787085430059), so that is what inspired this project.
